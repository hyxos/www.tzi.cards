We are pleased to announce that the software running [www.tzi.cards](https://WWW.TZI.CARDS "WWW.TZI.CARDS") is now released under an [MIT](https://github.com/hyxos/www.tzi.cards/blob/master/LICENSE ) Open Source Software license and that the content of this site is released under a Creative Commons Non-Commercial [(CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/ "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic") license.

## What Does this Mean?

In a nutshell, this means that the software we use to build and run this site is now open for you to inspect, contribute to, and borrow from through its repository on [github.com](https://github.com/hyxos/www.tzi.cards "github"). 

In addition, the content of this site is now open for your use in a variety of ways as long as you're not selling it. Please refer to the links at the top of this post to view the details of each license. We are planning to soon be adding a PDF that you can download along with a set of instructions that you can use to create your own deck!

## Why are We Doing This?

We have always wanted to open up TZI to the widest audience possible. And we love how the freedom of publishing straight to the internet provides greater accessability to our product for everyone.

This will also make it easier for others to help make this site and our product better. We use and rely on and use Open Source Software every day and want to open up our work to the community at large. Thank you to everyone who has supported us so far! We look forward to sharing more details soon.
