**TZI Cards** are organized according the ancient Chinese system of **Ganzhi (干支)**. The name, **TZI**, is in fact a [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization) of the character 子 (pinyin: zǐ), the first [Earthly Branch](earthly-branches).

In its origins, Ganzhi was primarily used as a way of organizing time through a [sexagenary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle) (base-60) cycle. The sixty cards of the deck correspond to the sixty units of the Ganzhi cycle. The yearly celebration of "Chinese New Year", a global event that reaches far beyond the borders of China, is rooted in Ganzhi.
