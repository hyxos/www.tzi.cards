[TZI Cards](https://www.tzi.cards) are organized according the ancient Chinese system of **Ganzhi (干支)**. The word, *TZI*, is a [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization) of the Chinese character [子](tzi), the first of the [Earthly Branches](earthly-branches). It is also associated with the first of the [animals](animals), the [Rat](rat).

In its origins, Ganzhi was primarily used as a way of organizing time through a [sexagenary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle) (base-60) cycle. The sixty cards of the deck correspond to the sixty units of the Ganzhi cycle. The yearly celebration of "Chinese New Year", a global event that reaches far beyond the borders of China, is rooted in Ganzhi.
