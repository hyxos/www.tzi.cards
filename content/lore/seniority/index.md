## Number One is First  
Each card has their [seniority](seniority) indicated in the top left hand corner inside a circle. The numbers range from one ([Wood Rat](wood-rat)), to sixty ([Water Pig](water-pig)).  

### Respect your Elders
*Seniority* is the opposite of *rank* in traditional playing cards. (1) is the highest while (60) is the lowest.

### But why? 
The matrix product of the [Twelve Earthly Branches](earthly-branches) and [Ten Heavenly Stems](heavenly-stems) follow a specific order.
