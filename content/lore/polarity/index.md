>The beginning was where it all started. <br /><small><em>~Mu Mao~</em> <strong>The Book of TZI</strong></small>

All cultures have their own creation stories. There is a tale from ancient China about the origin of the universe known as the 道 (Dào). 

In English, this is usually translated as the [Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao 'Tao'), aka: *The Way*. Its origins can be traced to over 2500 years ago, primarily through the writings of [Laozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi 'Laozi') in the text [Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching 'Tao Te Ching'). Today there are approximately [two and a half million adherents of Taoism](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=taoism "Wolfram Alpha: Taoism") worldwide, mostly located in Taiwan.

The symbol above, commonly known as the [Yin Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang "Yin Yang"), signifies the oneness of the universe that existed before the duality of light and darkness emerged. It is also one of many symbols of [Tai Chi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi 'Tai Chi') - 太極 - tàijí: *The Supreme Ultimate* martial art form.

## Look to the Sky

A central idea of Taoist philosophy is that *change* is a fundamental aspect of the universe. 

The exemplaries of this idea were known as the *Seven Luminaries*. These are the classical *planets* of the Western tradition; visible to ancient humans before the invention of the telescope.

Though the positions of the Seven Luminaries were constantly changing, over long enough time spans patterns in their movements emerged. Understanding these cycles and looking for relationships between the movements in the Heavens and corresponding events on Earth form the foundation of the field today known as astrology. The modern but related field of astronomy builds on this ancient tradition but is focused entirely on observation and prediction of the movement of the objects in the Heavens and maintains a relatively agnostic view of their influence over the Earth.

The Yang corresponds to the Sun, the dominant luminary of the day, while the Yin corresponds the Moon, the dominant luminary of the night.

The remaing five luminaries correspond to the [Five Elements](elements 'Five Elements') of [Wu Xing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing 'Wu Xing').

## Every Card has a Polarity

Other than the Sun, which by definition can only be seen during the day, the remaining luminaries under the proper conditions may be seen in the sky during the day or the night. Therefore, every element has a polarity reperesenting it's presence in the sky during the day or night.
