### 2-5 Players, 30-90 Minutes

<div id="overview">

## Overview
In Tu Tzi, players compete to build the most *[Powerful Formations](formations#powerful-formations "Formations")* to score points and win! 

Play is divided into rounds. During each round, players take turns *recruiting* by drawing cards, *building* by adding cards to their formation, and *discarding*. *See [Turn Actions](#turn-actions "turn actions").*

A round ends when the last player has completed their formation, or the stock pile is gone, whichever comes first. *See [Completing Round](#complete-round "Completing Round").*

Prior to scoring , if a player has the Tu Tzi card in their formation, they get one last opportunity to swap a card. *See [Tu Tzi Phase](#tu-tzi-phase "Tu Zi Phase").*

Points for the round are recorded, and deal passes to the left, or clockwise. *See [Scoring](#scoring "Scoring")*

The winner is the first player to reach 360 points or whoever has the the highest score after five rounds, whichever comes first. If multiple players surpass 360 points, the player with the highest score wins. *See [Winning](#winning "Winning")*

## Setup

Each player needs a flat area to build a 3 X 4 [grid formation](formations#grid "Formations") in front of them. You can play up to five players, but you will need a lot of space in order to do so!

Distribute one of the default grid formation cards to new players so that they have a blueprint to build from.

<br />
<br />

Players will need to see each other's formation(s) as the game progresses, so a nice table top is the perfect spot.

You will need to keep track of points throughout the game, so have a piece of paper and pencil handy. We like to use a game journal so that we can remember the scores from previous games and keep notes of any interesting occurences during gameplay like *special hands*.

## Choosing First Dealer

The person holding the cards shuffles the cards. Cards are then dealt face-up to all participating players. The first player to receive a rat is dealer for that round. 

### Awe, Rats!

That's right, because in TZI, rats are number one, baby! That means they are the highest valued cards by [*order*](seniority "Order") (The number inside the hexagon is always a 1 for a rat). In fact, the Chinese word for the *earthly branch* for all rats, is where we got the name for this game (TZOH!). Think of them kind of like Aces, but only tr√®s cooler.

The following round, dealer moves to the player on the left, or clockwise.
</div>
<br />
<div id="dealing">

## Deal those cards!

After choosing the dealer, it's time to deal. The dealer shuffles the cards again, then starts with the top card on the deck and goes clockwise around the table, dealing one card to each player until all players have seven cards.

Once all the players have their cards, the rest of the deck is placed face-down in a central location and is now called the *stock pile*. The top card is flipped over next to the stock pile. This face-up card is now the top card of the *discard pile*.

</div>
<br />

<div id="turn-actions">

## It's your turn!

Play begins to the left of the dealer (clockwise).

A turn is composed of three phases:

1. Recruiting Phase
    * Draw a card for your formation from the stock pile or the top card of the discard pile.
1. Building Phase 
    * Add a [*Trine*](formations#trines "trines") or a [*Square*](formations#squares "Square") to your formation if you are able and willing.
     * Recruit an additional card for every *completed* Trine or Square you add to your formation (this can continue as long as you are able to add Trines and Squares to your formation).
     * Exchange cards between your hand and formation in order to get more points (e.g. replacing *wood rat* with *fire rat* in order to create a *Unity Trine*).
1. Dismissal Phase 
    * Discard a card from your hand face-up onto the discard pile. Your turn is now over.
 
\* *If there are more than three players, you may start a second discard pile on the other side of the stock pile*
<br />

<div id="recruit">

### Recruiting

> I'm ready to go in coach, just give me a chance! <br /><small>*~Ace Ventura~ Pet Detective*</small>

Start your turn by *recruiting*- draw a card, either from the stock pile, or the discard pile- and add it to your hand.

Which card should you draw? Remember, the goal of Tu Tzi is toget the most points, by building the most *powerful formation*.

What makes a formation *powerful*? Building your formation is like building a team. If you were a coach trying to make the greatest basketball team *eva*, you could just take in any rando who comes in off the street, but unless you were just unimaginably lucky that strategy isn't gonna cut it. 

All players have strengths and weaknesses, and some work together better than others. A *powerful formation* is one that has certain qualities. The qualities that make a great team in Tu Tzi are *Diversity* and *Unity*, or some combination of the two. *Diversity* means all different elements and *Unity* means they are all the same element. The difficulty of making a *powerful formation* increases as the formation becomes more powerful.

Check out the section on [formations](formations "Formations") to get a better idea of what you are trying to accomplish.

<div id="build">

### Building

>Unlimited Power!<br /><small>~Emperor Palpatine~ The Revenge of the Sith</small>

When starting out, it can be challenging just grouping the cards together into [Trines](formations#trines "trines") and [Squares](formations#squares "Square"), much less building *powerful formations*.

Fear not, in time you will learn to wield that power!

Beginners may find it helpful to place all their cards face-up in front of them in the appropriate spots, even if they do not have any complete formations. Prior to familiarity with the TZI Glyphs, it can be a helpful way to see which cards you need.

Now, look at the the cards in your hand (or in front of you if you're playing open hand), can you complete a [square](formations#squares "Square") or [trine](formations#trines "Trines")? If so, (and you haven't already), place it on the table in front of you face-up. This is how you begin your grid formation! Use the TZI Glyph in the top left hand corner of the cards to help you see which cards belong in which group. Refer to the default *formation card* if you need help.

[*Powerful formations*](formations#powerful-formations "Powerful Formations") are Trines and Squares where the *elements* are all different (see *diversity*), or all the same (see *Unity*). There are also *super powerful formations* called [*Special Hands*](formations#special-hands "Special Hands"), where the Trines and Squares align in an extra special way.

If you complete a Trine or Square, recruit an additional card from the stockpile or the discard pile. Sometimes it is possible to complete *both* a Trine and a Square with one card - in this case you pick up *two* cards.

You may play as many face-up cards that fit in your formation, and may swap out any cards between your hand and your formation at any time during your turn, but you must have a card to discard at the end of your turn.

\* *If you are playing with an open-hand, you may have to discard from an uncompleted Trine or Square in the formation you have showing.*

</div>

<br/>

<div id="dismiss">

### Dismissing

You've got some hard choices to make. I mean, all of the cards are special in their own way, but not all of them can help your build your *powerful formation*? And also, if you say bye-bye to *wood ox*, is that going to help your opponent get [*Feng Shui*](formations#feng-shui "Feng Shui")?

You end your turn by discarding a card from your hand to the discard pile. In a four or five-player game, an additional discard pile should be formed on the other side of the stockpile. After dealing, only one card is flipped, but players may subsequently discard to or draw from either pile.

</div>

<br />

<div id="next-player">

### Next Player
Play continues to the left until the final player completes their formation, or the stockpile has been exhausted. 

In the case that where the stockpile has been exhausted and not all players have completed their formations, players may still draw a card from the discard pile and discard as usual, or choose to do nothing and pass. Once all players have passed, or the final player completes their formation (whichever comes first), play stops.

</div>

</div>

<br />

<div id="complete-round">

## Completing the Round

The main portion of the round is over when all players have completed their formations or the stock pile is empty and all players have passed on recruiting any of the remaining top cards from the discard piles, whichever comes first.

A complete formation should consist of exactly three squares and four trines. Every one of the twelve animals should be represented, though the different elements may vary. For beginners, the TZI Glyphs from each card should line up like they do in the default *formation card*. (see [*formations*](formations "Formations") for information on alternate arrangements).

When/If the last player completes their formation, they draw from the stock pile accordingly if there are any cards left in it, and then discard exactly as they would in any other turn. The game immediately moves to the Tu Tzi phase.

<div id="tu-tzi-phase">

### The Tu Tzi Phase  

<img alt="Tu Tzi" src="images/25_earth_rat_icon.png" style="width: 100px;" /><br />
<small>Behold the all-powerful Tu Tzi</small>

#### What Makes You So Special?

By now, if you have been paying attention and are starting to get to know your way around the TZI Glyphs, you'll probably have noticed that the TZI Glyphs on the default *formation card* aren't just any TZI Glyphs. That's right, they are all TZI Glyphs of a certain element, that element being *earth*. (If you still don't get it, no worries. Check out [The Antomy of a TZI Glyph](glyphs "The Anatomy of a TZI Glyph"))

That's because in addition to the *colour* of the cards, the *dots* on the TZI Glyphs tell you what *element* the card is.

And the glyph for Tu Tzi is the most simple of them all. It's just a centered, yellow, *vertical line*. That's because when there are *no dots*, we are always dealing with a TZI Glyph of the [element](elements "Elements") earth.

<img alt="Tu Tzi" src="images/25_earth_rat_glyph.png" style="width: 100px;"/>
<br />
<small><em>Consider this glyph to be like a super symbol on earth rat's chest</em></small>

<br />

If you were wondering why this game has such a silly name, well now you know. We could have just called it *Earth Rat* but now how fun now is that?

<img alt="Earth Rat Card" src="images/25_earth_rat_card.png" style="width: 150px" />
<br />
<small><em>Hello there, looking for me?</em></small>
<br />
<br />

So, even though play is over for everyone else, the player who has Tu Tzi in their final formation gets to switch any ONE of the cards in their formation with a card from: 
* Their own hand 
* Another player‚Äôs formation
* Another player‚Äôs hand (blind draw)
* The top card in the stock pile
* The top card in the discard pile

If the player with Tu Tzi takes a card from another player's formation, they must have a card to exchange (e.g. Player 1 takes *green dragon* from their formation and switches it with *red dragon* from Player 2's formation). They cannot simply take a card from another player's formation and add it to their own!

There is, however, one way to stay safe from that sly yellow rat, [*special hands*](formations#special-hands "Special Hands") are immune to Tu Tzi! She isn't allowed to work her magic on any player whose formation is a special hand.

#### What About Me?

I know, by this point some of you may be crying out, "It's not fair!" that Tu Tzi is so special. Well, for the standard game, you'll just have to live with it. However, in the *alternative rules*, each player gets to be their own Tu Tzi for the bonus.

*Check out the [Alternative Rules](alt-rules "Alternative Rules").*

<div id="scoring">

## Points & Scoring

At the end of each round, the points from each player's formation are calculated and added to the points of the previous round (if any).

Building [*Powerful Formations*](formations#powerful-formations "Powerful Formations") is the bread and butter of winning at Tu Tzi. But just what is it that makes these formations *powerful* in the first place? It's all about *probabilities*.

### Probably Maybe

We won't get into [probabality mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") here, but the jist is this: The points scored for building each formation are related to the *probability* of getting that formation; the *lower* the probability, the *higher* the points.

In other words, the *probability* of forming a *basic* [Trine](formations#trines "Trines") or [Square](formations#squares "Squares"), through the course of a game of Tu Tzi, is relatively high, so they're not worth any points. Forming a Unity Trine or a Unity Square however, is much more difficult. Since Unity is less likely to happen, it's worth more points.

<br />

#### Scoring for Trines & Squares
| *Formation*                   | *Points* |
|-------------------            |-------|
| Basic Trine                   |   0   |
| Basic Square                  |   0   |
| Diversity Trine               |  10   |
| Diversity Square              |  20   |
| Unity Trine                   |  30   |
| Unity Square                  |  50   |

[*Special Hand*](formations#special-hands "Special Hands")  are even more difficult to pull off and therefore worth even more points! If you are able to create one of these formations during gameplay, they have the additional benefit of protecting you from Tu Tzi at the end of the game.

In fact, you can potentially win the game in *one round* if you get that most special of special hands: [*Elemental Imperium*](formations#elemental-imperium "Elemental Imperium")!

If your final formation conforms to one of the special hands, then you score them according to the chart below.

#### Scoring for [Special Hands](formations#special-hands "Special Hands")
| [*Special Hand*](formations#special-hands "Special Hands")                | *Points* |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [Feng Shui](formations#feng-shui "Feng Shui")                                | 180   |
| [Coup D'Etat](formations#coup-detat "Coup D'Etat")                           | 210   |
| [Triumverate](formations#triumverate "Triumverate")                          | 250   |
| [Church & State](formations#church-state "Church and State")                 | 300   |
| [Elemental Imperium](formations#elemental-imperium "Elemental Imperium")     | 360   |

## Winning

>This game is called "I Win!"<br /> <small>*~Tu Wei~*</small>

You've battled it out, you've built your *powerful formations* of Trines and Squares, maybe you even managed to reach the glorious achievement of building one of those *Special Hands*! 

The first player to reach 360, or the player with the highest score after five rounds is declared the winner! If multiple players have surpassed 360 points, the player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, you must share the glory- or play another round.
