## Fighting Numbers
### 2 - 6 players, 30 minutes, Ages 8+

A trick taking game where players compete to achieve a winning score of 12. 

4 or 6 player game is played in partners. Partners sit opposite one another and tricks are collected together.

Shuffle the deck
First Rat deals
Players (or partners) are trying to collect the most tricks played in the round- 7 in total. Highest card (or lowest seniority) takes the trick. 
Deal 7 cards to each player. Remainder of deck is placed face down in the middle of the table and becomes the stockpile.
First trick declares wangpai. Wangpai is determined at the beginning of each round. It is a special element and animal that beats other elements, despite actual seniority, and is decided in the first trick. In the case where more than one wangpai is played in a trick, lowest seniority wins.
Each player looks through their hand and chooses one of their cards to submit for wangpai. When chosen, players place their card face down in front of them. Once all players have made a selection, players agree and all reveal their selections simultaneously. Highest rank wins wangpai, 1 being the highest, 60 the lowest.
The wangpai card is placed face up on the top of the stock pile. For the remainder of the round, all cards sharing the same element or animal as the wangpai card are considered wangpai. The losing cards from the first trick are taken by the winner and placed in front of them, face down. They have won the first trick, and now have the lead. Winner of the last trick always leads and play continues clockwise. 
All players must play the same element that is lead, if they can. If unable to follow the element, the player may wangpai the trick, or play any other card. Winner of the trick is the highest rank of wangpai, otherwise the highest rank of the element lead. Remember lowest seniority is the highest rank. The winner of a trick leads the following trick.
Round continues until all 7 tricks are decided. Players (or partners) count how many tricks won.
If the player (or partnership) who called wangpai wins the most tricks, they get 1 point. 
If the player (or partnership) who did not call wangpai wins the most tricks, they get 2 points. 
If the player (or partnership) who did not call wangpai wins the remaining 6 tricks, they get 3 points.
If a player (or partnership) wins all the tricks, they get 5 points.
First player or team to reach 12 points wins.
