>Every symbol has many names, every name has many symbols. <br /><br />~Mu Mao~ The Book of TZI

The TZI cards are composed using a combination of numbers and symbols. All words on the cards are expressed using [Traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese Characters") and modern [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin") to assist with pronunciation. Each card contains the following parts:

* [Polarity](../polarity "Polarity")
* [Element](elements "Element")
* [Animal](animals "Animal")
* [Animal Order](animals "Animal Order")
* [TZI Glyph](glyphs "TZI Glyph")
* [Seniority](seniority "Seniority")
* [Earthly Branch](earthly-branches "Earthly Branches")
* [Heavenly Stem](heavenly-stems "Heavenly Stem")

## A Card by Any Other Name

The cards can be referred to in a number of ways. One of the simplest ways is to use the *element* name plus the *animal* name.
Another way would be to use the *colour* and the *animal* name.

For example, in English you could say:
* Earth Rat
* Yellow Rat

Or, if you want to practice your Pinyin and Chinese, it would be:
* 土鼠	- tǔ shǔ
* 黄鼠 - huáng shǔ

To refer to the card by its Ganzhi name you would use the *heavenly stem* plus the *earthly branch*:
* 戊子 - wù zǐ

When creating TZI, we found it useful to refer to the cards by their *element* name plus the *earthly branch*:
* 土子 - Tu Tzi

In fact, that is how the name of the first game developed for the deck ([Tu Zi](tu-tzi "Tu Zi")), came about!
