## An Ancient Past

TZI Cards draw their inspiration from a variety of sources, primarily the ancient Chinese system of *Ganzhi*. Explore the origins and background of the cards in the [Lore](lore) section.

## A New Beginning
TZI Cards incorporate a new figure, the [TZI Glyph](tzi-glpyh) which can be seen as not only as way to uniquely identify each card but also to reveal patterns previously obscured.
      
### TZI Cards vs Traditional Playing Cards
If you are already familiar with playing games with traditional playing cards, in order to help explain the organization of a deck of TZI Cards, here are a few key differences that can be kept in mind...

#### Seniority vs Rank

Traditional playing cards establish the value of cards through the idea of *rank*, lower numbered cards are of lower value.

TZI Cards turn this upside down through the concept of [Seniority](seniority). The value of cards is determined in order of who comes first.

#### Elements vs Suits

Traditional playing cards are made up of four *suits*: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.

By contrast, TZI Cards instead are composed of five [Elements](elements): [Wood](wood), [Fire](wood), [Earth](earth), [Metal](metal), and [Water](water).

#### Animals vs Numbered and Face Cards

Though each TZI Card has an [order](order) that goes into determining their [seniority](seniority), they are usually referred to by using a combination of the [element](elements) and [animal](animals) that appear on the card.

Since there are five elements and twelve animals, this produces a deck of sixty cards, as opposed to the fourty-eight in a deck of tradtional playing cards.

#### The Sky is the Limit

Many games that can be played with traditional playing cards can be adapted to play with the TZI Cards deck.

We encourage you to try playing your favourite card game with the TZI Cards deck (e.g. Rummy, Poker, etc.). Children's games like Old Maid or Go Fish can be fun as well!
