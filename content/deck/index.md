### TZI Cards vs Traditional Playing Cards -> [Games](games)
One of the exciting things about TZI Cards is that the sixty card deck creates some unique properties that enables game play not possible with traditional playing cards. Here are some of the features.

#### Seniority vs Rank
Traditional playing cards establish the value of cards through the idea of *rank*, lower numbered cards are of lower value.

TZI Cards turn this upside down through the concept of [Seniority](seniority). The value of cards is determined in order of who comes first.

#### Elements vs Suits
Traditional playing cards are made up of four *suits*: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.

By contrast, TZI Cards instead are composed of five [Elements](elements): [Wood](wood), [Fire](wood), [Earth](earth), [Metal](metal), and [Water](water).

#### Animals vs Numbered and Face Cards
Though each TZI Card has an [order](order) and [seniority](seniority), they are usually referred to by using a combination of the [element](elements) and [animal](animals) that appear on the card.

#### The Sky is the Limit
Many games that can be played with traditional playing cards can be adapted to play with the TZI Cards deck.

We encourage you to try playing your favourite card game with the TZI Cards deck (e.g. Rummy, Poker, etc.). Children's games like Old Maid or Go Fish can be fun as well!
