TZI Cards are inspired by the ancient system of Ganzhi. This system creates a product of the matrix of the Twelve Earthly Branches and Ten Heavenly Stems that follow a specific order.

Each card has their *seniority* indicated in the top left hand corner inside a circle. The number is between 1 and 60.

One (Wood Rat) is the highest seniority while sixty (Water Pig) is the lowest seniority.

An index key card of the 60 glyphs in order, arranged in their cohorts, is included in a standard TZI deck.
