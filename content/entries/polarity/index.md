>The beginning was where it all started. <br /><small><em>~Mu Mao~</em> <strong>The Book of TZI</strong></small>

All cultures have their own creation stories, and the ancient Chinese tale of the origin of the universe is told to us through the 道 (Dào). 

In English, this is usually translated as **Tao**, aka: *The Way*. Its origins can be traced to over 2500 years ago, primarily through the text of Laozi (*I Ching* - The Book of Changes). Today there are approximately [two and a half million adherents of Taoism](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=taoism "Wolfram Alpha: Taoism") worldwide, mostly located in Taiwan.

The symbol above, in the west commonly known as the "Yin Yang" symbol, is one of many symbols of *T'ai chi* - 太極 - tàijí: *The Supreme Ultimate*, which signifies the oneness of the universe that existed before the duality of light and darkness emerged.

## Every Card has a Polarity

Like the two sides of the "Yin Yang", all cards are either *positive* or *negative* in their polarity. These words are used in a technical rather than moral sense, like poles of a magnet or a battery.

*TZI Cards indicate their polarity by having a white background with coloured symbols (yang), or a coloured background with white symbols (yin).*
